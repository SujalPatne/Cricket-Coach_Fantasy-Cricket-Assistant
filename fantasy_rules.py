üëë **Fantasy Cricket Captain & Vice-Captain Rules**

In fantasy cricket, selecting the right captain and vice-captain is crucial:

**Captain**:
- Your captain earns 2x (double) points for all their actions in the match
- For example, if a player scores 50 runs (50 points) as captain, you'll get 100 points

**Vice-Captain**:
- Your vice-captain earns 1.5x points for all their actions
- For example, if a player takes 3 wickets (75 points) as vice-captain, you'll get 112.5 points

**Strategy Tips**:
- Select in-form players for these roles
- All-rounders make great captains as they can earn points from both batting and bowling
- Consider the pitch conditions and match situation
- Look at the player's history at the venue
- For T20s, consider picking explosive batsmen or death-over specialists
- For test matches and ODIs, consistent performers are usually safer choices

Remember: Your captain and vice-captain selections often make the difference between winning and losing in fantasy cricket!

üîÑ **Fantasy Cricket Substitution Rules**

Different fantasy cricket platforms have different substitution rules, but here are the general guidelines:

**Before Match Deadline**:
- You can make unlimited changes to your team until the match deadline
- Once the match/tournament starts, your team gets locked

**Multi-Match Tournaments**:

  - A set number of free substitutions for the entire tournament (e.g., 75-100 changes)
  - Ability to make team changes between matches
  - Opportunity to change captain and vice-captain between matches

**Injury Replacements**:
- If a selected player is declared unfit before the match and doesn't play, you don't get points

**Last-Minute Changes**:
- Always check team news before deadline to ensure your players are in the playing XI
- Pay attention to toss results as they can impact team selections and pitch conditions

Remember to use your substitutions wisely throughout a tournament to maximize your points potential!
