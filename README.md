## Data Sources and Caching

The Fantasy Cricket Assistant uses multiple data sources to provide comprehensive cricket information:

### Cricsheet Data (Historical)

- **Features**:
  - Selective downloading of only required data
  - Efficient caching system with configurable expiration times
  - Detailed player statistics extraction from ball-by-ball data
  - Cached in `cricsheet_data/cache` directory

### Cricbuzz API via RapidAPI (Real-time)
- **Purpose**: Provides real-time match scores and current player form
- **Features**:
  - Live match scores and status updates
  - Current player form and recent performances
  - Team and venue information

### Intelligent Data Integration
- **Smart Selection**: System intelligently chooses between data sources based on query type
- **Data Merging**: Combines historical data with real-time updates
- **Cache Management**:
  - Player data cached with timestamps
  - Automatic refresh of outdated cache
  - Transparent loading indicators showing data source and status

### Fallback System
